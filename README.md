### for fix above 2 issues of css and images support I have to do these below steps

#### Extra useful configs

```

Babel config for CSS files

npm install style-loader --save-dev
npm install --save-dev css-loader

module.export = {
  ...
  "module": {
    "rules": [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      ....
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
Babel config for images

npm i -D file-loader

module.export = {
  ...
  "module": {
    "rules": [
      {
        test: /\.(png|jp(e*)g|svg|gif)$/,
        use: ['file-loader'],
      },
      ....
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
Babel config for SVG as react component
module.export = {
  ...
  "module": {
    "rules": [
      {
        test: /\.svg$/,
        use: ['@svgr/webpack'],
      },
      ....
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
